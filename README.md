# Proxily Classic Redux-Style ToDo List

## Usage
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After checking out the project, run these commands in the project directory:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

> Note: Until Proxily is published on NPM you need to have it in an adjacent folder.  You run yarn install, yarn build and then remove node_modules.  This must be done before the above steps.

# The Application

This application is identical to the [sample todoList](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos)
app.

## Folders
* components has the reaction functional components
* store has the two classes Todo and Todos
